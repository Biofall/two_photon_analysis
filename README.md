# two_photon_analysis

This project is intended to serve as a complete package for analyzing visual areas of the drosophila brain using two-photon imaging.
A majority of the backbone of the analysis comes from visanalysis, a code package written primarily by Max Turner: https://github.com/ClandininLab/visanalysis. Go into the directory level that has "setup.py" file
in it and run the following command to add these tools to your virtual environment.
